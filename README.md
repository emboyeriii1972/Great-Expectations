# Great-Expectations

My dream job would be designing retro consoles like the Atari 2600.  I am a huge fan of "old school" devices because they are still simple enough that a single human being could grasp the entirety of them from the software to the hardware.  I would be a modern day David Crane if there was a market for that sort of job.
